# Balanced testing

Testing 100% of every single thing is impossible. Testing close to everything is expensive. Almost no business can afford it. The important thing is to find a balance between what to test, how much to test, and which way to test. This is so that you spend the minimum time possible on it while still guaranteeing maximum quality.

Test what is reasonable since the unthinkable will happen anyway - and when it does, you want to catch it before the user reports come in.

**How to be prepared:**

- Apply a zero-exception policy that detects all application problems
- Monitor performance in different layers of your system
- Add end-to-end tracing
- Use synthetic API / interface monitoring to detect happy flow problems

An important part of the testing strategy is to understand when it’s beneficial to test and when the monitoring will be more effective. However, you will need both anyway and both of them are critical to use together with CDP.

So in the end, testing and monitoring will give you the best quality and speed for the money.
